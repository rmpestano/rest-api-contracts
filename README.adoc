A sample application to demo https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-contract[Spring cloud contract].

This repository contains a https://github.com/rmpestano/rest-api-contracts/tree/master/addition-api/[producer API] and a https://github.com/rmpestano/rest-api-contracts/tree/master/calculator-api[consumer API].

`Addition API` just sums 2 numbers:

`Calculator API` is the client of Addition API and uses `contract tests` to verify API changes *at build time*:
